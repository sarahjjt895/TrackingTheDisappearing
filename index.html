    <h2>How did we get here?</h2>
    <p>Animals are becoming endangered due to various factors such as habitat loss, climate change, pollution,
      overexploitation, invasive species, human-wildlife conflict, and inadequate conservation efforts. These threats
      disrupt ecosystems and pose significant challenges to animal populations.</p>

    <p>Habitat loss, caused by activities like deforestation and urbanization, deprives animals of their natural
      habitats and resources. Climate change, with rising temperatures and extreme weather events, affects food
      availability and habitat suitability, making it difficult for species to adapt.</p>

    <p>Pollution, including air, water, and soil pollution, harms animals and their ecosystems, leading to poisoning,
      diseases, and reproductive issues. Overexploitation through hunting and illegal trade depletes endangered species.
    </p>

    <p>Invasive species disrupt native ecosystems by outcompeting native species and spreading diseases. Human-wildlife
      conflict arises as human populations encroach upon wildlife habitats, leading to the killing or displacement of
      animals.</p>

    <p>Inadequate conservation efforts, such as limited funding and weak enforcement, contribute to the endangerment of
      animals. Addressing these issues requires habitat preservation, sustainable practices, conservation initiatives,
      and raising awareness about biodiversity.</p>

    <p> Protecting endangered species and their habitats is crucial for maintaining balanced ecosystems and ensuring the
      long-term survival of animals and humans alike.</p>
    <div id="chart"></div>
    <p>The dataset above reveals alarming insights into the causes behind animal endangerment, primarily driven by human
      activities. Deforestation stands out as a significant threat, with over 2,000 species at risk due to the
      widespread clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urbanization. Overfishing is another pressing
      concern, directly impacting approximately 1,400 endangered species and necessitating sustainable fishing practices
      and better regulations. Poaching, pollution, climate change, habitat destruction, and invasive species also
      contribute to species endangerment to varying degrees.</p>
  
    <p>Poaching, the illegal hunting and capturing of animals, poses a substantial risk to around 1,200 species.
      Pollution, including land, water, and air pollution, endangers roughly 1,000 species, while climate change affects
      approximately 700 species. Habitat destruction threatens 500 species, and invasive species are a concern for
      nearly 200 species. Combating these threats requires strengthening anti-poaching measures, implementing strict
      environmental regulations, mitigating climate change, promoting sustainable land use, and managing invasive
      species effectively.</p>
  
    <p>The dataset underscores the urgent need for comprehensive conservation strategies and sustainable practices to
      protect endangered species. By addressing deforestation, overfishing, poaching, pollution, climate change, habitat
      destruction, and invasive species, we can help mitigate the risks and ensure the survival of vulnerable animal
      populations. It is crucial to foster awareness, promote responsible actions, and collaborate on a global scale to
      safeguard biodiversity and preserve the intricate balance of our ecosystems for future generations.</p>

                <h3>Red Panda</h3>
                <p>The red panda has become endangered due to various factors, primarily habitat loss and fragmentation.
                  Deforestation, as a result of logging, agriculture, and infrastructure development, has significantly
                  reduced the red panda's natural habitat. The conversion of forests into farmland and settlements has
                  left them with limited areas to survive.</p>
                <p>Additionally, climate change has impacted the red panda's habitat. Rising temperatures and changes in
                  precipitation patterns have led to alterations in the vegetation and availability of bamboo, which is
                  the primary food source for red pandas. These changes affect their ability to find sufficient food and
                  suitable habitats.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the illegal wildlife trade poses a significant threat to red pandas. They are sought
                  after for their distinctive fur and as exotic pets. The demand for red panda pelts and body parts,
                  driven by the illegal market, has further contributed to their decline.</p>

                <p>Conservation efforts are focused on protecting and restoring red panda habitats, implementing
                  anti-poaching measures, and raising awareness about their conservation needs. These initiatives aim to
                  address the threats facing red pandas and promote their long-term survival in the wild.</p>

                <h3>Amur Leopard</h3>
                <p>The Amur leopard is critically endangered due to various factors that have contributed to its
                  declining population. Here is a short summary explaining how and why this has happened:</p>

                <p>1. Habitat Loss: The primary reason for the decline of the Amur leopard is habitat loss. Human
                  activities, such as logging, agriculture, and infrastructure development, have led to the destruction
                  and fragmentation of the leopard's natural habitat, primarily found in the Russian Far East and parts
                  of Northeast China.</p>

                <p>2. Poaching: Poaching for their beautiful fur and body parts remains a significant threat to the Amur
                  leopard. Their unique and highly valuable pelts are sought after in illegal wildlife trade markets,
                  leading to continued hunting pressure.</p>

                <p>3. Prey Scarcity: The Amur leopard's survival is closely linked to the availability of prey species,
                  such as deer and wild boar. Overhunting of these prey species, competition with human activities, and
                  declining food sources have resulted in limited prey availability for the leopards.</p>

                <p>4. Human-Wildlife Conflict: As human settlements expand into leopard habitats, conflicts between
                  humans and leopards arise. These conflicts often result in the leopards being killed due to perceived
                  threats to human safety or retaliatory actions for livestock predation.</p>

                <p>5. Low Population Size: The Amur leopard's population is naturally small and isolated, making it more
                  vulnerable to genetic threats, such as inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity. These factors can
                  weaken their overall fitness and resilience to environmental changes.</p>

                <p>Conservation efforts, including protected areas, anti-poaching measures, and habitat restoration,
                  have been implemented to save the Amur leopard from extinction. However, continued collaborative
                  efforts involving local communities, governments, and conservation organizations are crucial to ensure
                  the survival and recovery of this critically endangered species.</p>

                <h3>Tasmanian Tiger</h3>
                <p>The Tasmanian tiger, also known as the thylacine, became extinct primarily due to human activities
                  and factors related to colonization. Here is a short summary explaining how and why the Tasmanian
                  tiger became extinct:

                <p>1. Hunting and Persecution: The Tasmanian tiger was hunted and persecuted by European settlers who
                  considered it a threat to livestock. The government in Tasmania even implemented a bounty system that
                  rewarded people for killing thylacines, leading to widespread hunting and trapping of the species.</p>

                <p>2. Habitat Loss: The expansion of human settlements, agriculture, and logging activities resulted in
                  significant habitat loss for the Tasmanian tiger. The destruction of its natural habitat reduced its
                  available range and resources, further endangering the population.</p>

                <p>3. Disease and Competition: The introduction of domestic dogs, as well as diseases carried by these
                  dogs, posed a significant threat to the Tasmanian tiger. The thylacines had no natural immunity
                  against these diseases, and competition with introduced predators such as foxes further impacted their
                  survival.</p>

                <p>4. Lack of Conservation Efforts: Insufficient conservation efforts and the absence of protective
                  measures contributed to the decline and eventual extinction of the Tasmanian tiger. The species was
                  not adequately studied, understood, or protected during its existence, which hindered conservation
                  initiatives.</p>

                <p>The last known Tasmanian tiger died in captivity in 1936, marking the extinction of the species.
                  Despite unconfirmed reports and occasional sightings, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that
                  the Tasmanian tiger still exists in the wild today. The extinction of the Tasmanian tiger serves as a
                  poignant reminder of the impact of human actions on species survival and the importance of
                  conservation efforts to prevent the loss of biodiversity.</p>

    <h2> What does this mean for our future?</h2>
    <p>Based on the provided data set on endangered animals per country, we can draw the following
      conclusions and insights:</p>

    <p>Distribution of Endangered Animals: The quantities represent the number of endangered animals in each country. By
      analyzing this data, we can identify countries with a higher concentration of endangered animals. For example,
      Madagascar has the highest number of endangered animals (121), followed by Mexico (96), India (93), and the Euro
      area (99). These countries should be a focus for conservation efforts due to the high number of endangered
      species.</p>

    <p>Regional Patterns: Examining the data allows us to observe regional patterns in endangered animal populations.
      For instance, countries within the Euro area and the Caribbean small states exhibit relatively high numbers of
      endangered animals. This information can help target regional conservation strategies and collaborations.</p>

    <p>Disparities in Endangered Animal Numbers: The data reveals significant disparities in the number of endangered
      animals among countries. While some countries have very few or even zero endangered animals, others have a
      substantial count. This indicates that certain countries might have implemented effective conservation measures,
      while others may need to prioritize conservation efforts to protect their endangered species.</p>

    <p>Large Countries and Endangered Animals: Larger countries tend to have higher numbers of endangered animals due to
      their larger land areas and diverse ecosystems. For instance, countries like the United States, Canada, China,
      Brazil, and Australia have notable quantities of endangered animals. Preserving the habitats and ecosystems within
      these countries is crucial for the conservation of their endangered species.</p>

    <p>Global Significance: The "World" entry in the Country Name column indicates that the data represents a global
      overview. It might represent data that aggregates information from various countries or regions or includes data
      for territories or regions that are not individually listed. Understanding the global picture of endangered
      animals is essential for implementing international conservation efforts and promoting global biodiversity.</p>

    <p>Missing Data: Some entries have missing values, such as the Channel Islands and certain territories like Isle of
      Man and Kosovo. It's important to ensure that missing data is appropriately handled and considered when drawing
      conclusions from the dataset.</p>

    <p>These insights can guide policymakers, conservationists, and organizations in identifying regions that require
      immediate attention for conservation efforts and provide a broader understanding of the distribution and
      challenges surrounding endangered animals worldwide.</p>
